The current project contains the six pages site about TRAA. All pages are responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop version, also added media quires on breakpoints). Site designed in bright colors. The main colors are green, orange and grey. The mobile version has a slide bar for the menu, also the index page has an animation for icons by using GreenSock (TweenMax and TweenLite). Our team added a video about TRAA (it's located in ABOUT PAGE). In the MEMBERSHIP page, we added a gallery for products. The pages is 'home', 'about us', 'membership', 'projects', 'events', 'contacts'. Also, we have different js files because it is a different animation on pages. All pages linked to each other. In tablet and desktop version main navigation has slide animation. Also, the site has text animation for headings.
